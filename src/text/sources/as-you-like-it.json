    "\n",
    "ORLANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me\n",
    "by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st, charged my\n",
    "brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my\n",
    "sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks\n",
    "goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home,\n",
    "or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call\n",
    "you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from\n",
    "the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that\n",
    "they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and\n",
    "to that end riders dearly hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing\n",
    "under him but growth; for the which his animals on his dunghills are\n",
    "as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so\n",
    "plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his\n",
    "countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds,\n",
    "bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my\n",
    "gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and\n",
    "the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny\n",
    "against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know\n",
    "no wise remedy how to avoid it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter OLIVER\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me\n",
    "up.                                           [ADAM retires]\n",
    "OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here?\n",
    "ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.\n",
    "OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?\n",
    "ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a\n",
    "poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.\n",
    "OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What\n",
    "prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?\n",
    "OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?\n",
    "ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.\n",
    "OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir?\n",
    "ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are\n",
    "my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you\n",
    "should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better\n",
    "in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not\n",
    "away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as\n",
    "much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming\n",
    "before me is nearer to his reverence.\n",
    "OLIVER. What, boy!                               [Strikes him]\n",
    "ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.\n",
    "OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?\n",
    "ORLANDO. I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de\n",
    "Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such\n",
    "a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not\n",
    "take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy\n",
    "tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.\n",
    "ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's\n",
    "remembrance, be at accord.\n",
    "OLIVER. Let me go, I say.\n",
    "ORLANDO. I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father\n",
    "charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have\n",
    "train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all\n",
    "gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in\n",
    "me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such\n",
    "exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor\n",
    "allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy\n",
    "my fortunes.\n",
    "OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,\n",
    "get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have\n",
    "some part of your will. I pray you leave me.\n",
    "ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.\n",
    "OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.\n",
    "ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in\n",
    "your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke\n",
    "such a word.\n",
    "Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM\n",
    "OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic\n",
    "your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla,\n",
    "Dennis!\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter DENNIS\n",
    "\n",
    "DENNIS. Calls your worship?\n",
    "OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?\n",
    "DENNIS. So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access\n",
    "to you.\n",
    "OLIVER. Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and\n",
    "to-morrow the wrestling is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter CHARLES\n",
    "\n",
    "CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.\n",
    "OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new\n",
    "court?\n",
    "CHARLES. There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that\n",
    "is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;\n",
    "and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary\n",
    "exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;\n",
    "therefore he gives them good leave to wander.\n",
    "OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished\n",
    "with her father?\n",
    "CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,\n",
    "being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have\n",
    "followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at\n",
    "the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own\n",
    "daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.\n",
    "OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?\n",
    "CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many\n",
    "merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood\n",
    "of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,\n",
    "and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\n",
    "OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?\n",
    "CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a\n",
    "matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger\n",
    "brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against\n",
    "me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he\n",
    "that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.\n",
    "Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would\n",
    "be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come\n",
    "in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint\n",
    "you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,\n",
    "or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is\n",
    "thing of his own search and altogether against my will.\n",
    "OLIVER. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt\n",
    "find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my\n",
    "brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to\n",
    "dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,\n",
    "Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of\n",
    "ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret\n",
    "and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.\n",
    "Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his\n",
    "neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou\n",
    "dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace\n",
    "himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap\n",
    "thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he\n",
    "hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I\n",
    "assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one\n",
    "so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly\n",
    "of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush\n",
    "and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.\n",
    "CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come\n",
    "to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,\n",
    "I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!\n",
    "Exit\n",
    "OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I\n",
    "hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,\n",
    "hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and\n",
    "yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly\n",
    "beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and\n",
    "especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am\n",
    "altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler\n",
    "shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy\n",
    "thither, which now I'll go about.                       Exit\n",

    "SCENE II. A lawn before the DUKE'S palace\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter ROSALIND and CELIA\n",
    "\n",
    "CELIA. I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and\n",
    "would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget\n",
    "a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any\n",
    "extraordinary pleasure.\n",
    "CELIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I\n",
    "love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy\n",
    "uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I\n",
    "could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst\n",
    "thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd\n",
    "as mine is to thee.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to\n",
    "rejoice in yours.\n",
    "CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to\n",
    "have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what\n",
    "he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee\n",
    "again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that\n",
    "oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear\n",
    "Rose, be merry.\n",
    "ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.\n",
    "Let me see; what think you of falling in love?\n",
    "CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man\n",
    "in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety\n",
    "of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.\n",
    "ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?\n",
    "CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her\n",
    "wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily\n",
    "misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her\n",
    "gifts to women.\n",
    "CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes\n",
    "honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very\n",
    "ill-favouredly.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:\n",
    "Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of\n",
    "Nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter TOUCHSTONE\n",
    "\n",
    "CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by\n",
    "Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to\n",
    "flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off\n",
    "the argument?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when\n",
    "Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.\n",
    "CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but\n",
    "Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of\n",
    "such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for\n",
    "always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How\n",
    "now, wit! Whither wander you?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.\n",
    "CELIA. Were you made the messenger?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were\n",
    "good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.\n",
    "Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard\n",
    "was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.\n",
    "CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear\n",
    "by your beards that I am a knave.\n",
    "CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you\n",
    "swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this\n",
    "knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he\n",
    "had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or\n",
    "that mustard.\n",
    "CELIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.\n",
    "CELIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no\n",
    "more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise\n",
    "men do foolishly.\n",
    "CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that\n",
    "fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have\n",
    "makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter LE BEAU\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.\n",
    "CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.\n",
    "CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,\n",
    "Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?\n",
    "LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.\n",
    "CELIA. Sport! of what colour?\n",
    "LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?\n",
    "ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.\n",
    "CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-\n",
    "ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.\n",
    "LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good\n",
    "wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.\n",
    "LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your\n",
    "ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and\n",
    "here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.\n",
    "CELIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.\n",
    "LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-\n",
    "CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.\n",
    "LE BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.\n",
    "ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by\n",
    "these presents'-\n",
    "LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's\n",
    "wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of\n",
    "his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd\n",
    "the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,\n",
    "their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the\n",
    "beholders take his part with weeping.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Alas!\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have\n",
    "lost?\n",
    "LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time\n",
    "that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.\n",
    "CELIA. Or I, I promise thee.\n",
    "ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in\n",
    "his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we\n",
    "see this wrestling, cousin?\n",
    "LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place\n",
    "appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.\n",
    "CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,\n",
    "CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS\n",
    "\n",
    "FREDERICK. Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own\n",
    "peril on his forwardness.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Is yonder the man?\n",
    "LE BEAU. Even he, madam.\n",
    "CELIA. Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.\n",
    "FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to\n",
    "see the wrestling?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.\n",
    "FREDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,\n",
    "there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth\n",
    "I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to\n",
    "him, ladies; see if you can move him.\n",
    "CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.\n",
    "FREDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.\n",
    "[DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]\n",
    "LE BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.\n",
    "ORLANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?\n",
    "ORLANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come\n",
    "but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.\n",
    "CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.\n",
    "You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw\n",
    "yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the\n",
    "fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal\n",
    "enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own\n",
    "safety and give over this attempt.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be\n",
    "misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the\n",
    "wrestling might not go forward.\n",
    "ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,\n",
    "wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent\n",
    "ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go\n",
    "with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one\n",
    "sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is\n",
    "willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none\n",
    "to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only\n",
    "in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when\n",
    "I have made it empty.\n",
    "ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with\n",
    "you.\n",
    "CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!\n",
    "CELIA. Your heart's desires be with you!\n",
    "CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to\n",
    "lie with his mother earth?\n",
    "ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.\n",
    "FREDERICK. You shall try but one fall.\n",
    "CHARLES. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a\n",
    "second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.\n",
    "ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me\n",
    "before; but come your ways.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!\n",
    "CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the\n",
    "leg.                                          [They wrestle]\n",
    "ROSALIND. O excellent young man!\n",
    "CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should\n",
    "down.\n",
    "[CHARLES is thrown. Shout]\n",
    "FREDERICK. No more, no more.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.\n",
    "FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?\n",

    "Boys.\n",
    "FREDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.\n",
    "The world esteem'd thy father honourable,\n",
    "But I did find him still mine enemy.\n",
    "Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,\n",
    "Hadst thou descended from another house.\n",
    "But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;\n",
    "I would thou hadst told me of another father.\n",
    "Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU\n",
    "CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?\n",
    "ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,\n",
    "His youngest son- and would not change that calling\n",
    "To be adopted heir to Frederick.\n",
    "ROSALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,\n",
    "And all the world was of my father's mind;\n",
    "Had I before known this young man his son,\n",
    "I should have given him tears unto entreaties\n",
    "Ere he should thus have ventur'd.\n",
    "CELIA. Gentle cousin,\n",
    "Let us go thank him, and encourage him;\n",
    "My father's rough and envious disposition\n",
    "Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserv'd;\n",
    "If you do keep your promises in love\n",
    "But justly as you have exceeded all promise,\n",
    "Your mistress shall be happy.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]\n",
    "Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,\n",
    "That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.\n",
    "Shall we go, coz?\n",
    "CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts\n",
    "Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up\n",
    "Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.\n",
    "ROSALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;\n",
    "I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?\n",
    "Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown\n",
    "More than your enemies.\n",
    "CELIA. Will you go, coz?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Have with you. Fare you well.\n",

    "To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd\n",
    "High commendation, true applause, and love,\n",
    "Yet such is now the Duke's condition\n",
    "That he misconstrues all that you have done.\n",
    "The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,\n",
    "More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.\n",
    "ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:\n",
    "Which of the two was daughter of the Duke\n",
    "That here was at the wrestling?\n",
    "LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;\n",
    "But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;\n",
    "The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,\n",
    "And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,\n",
    "To keep his daughter company; whose loves\n",
    "Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.\n",
    "But I can tell you that of late this Duke\n",
    "Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,\n",
    "Grounded upon no other argument\n",
    "But that the people praise her for her virtues\n",
    "And pity her for her good father's sake;\n",
    "And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady\n",
    "Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.\n",
    "Hereafter, in a better world than this,\n",
    "I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.\n",

    "Not a word?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.\n",
    "CELIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;\n",
    "throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should\n",
    "be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.\n",
    "CELIA. But is all this for your father?\n",
    "ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of\n",
    "briers is this working-day world!\n",
    "CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday\n",
    "foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats\n",
    "will catch them.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my\n",
    "heart.\n",
    "CELIA. Hem them away.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.\n",
    "CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.\n",
    "ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.\n",
    "CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of\n",
    "a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in\n",
    "good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall\n",
    "into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?\n",
    "ROSALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.\n",
    "CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?\n",
    "By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his\n",
    "father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.\n",
    "ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.\n",
    "CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I\n",
    "do. Look, here comes the Duke.\n",
    "CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.\n",
    "FREDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,\n",
    "And get you from our court.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Me, uncle?\n",
    "FREDERICK. You, cousin.\n",
    "Within these ten days if that thou beest found\n",
    "So near our public court as twenty miles,\n",
    "Thou diest for it.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace,\n",
    "Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.\n",
    "If with myself I hold intelligence,\n",
    "Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;\n",
    "If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-\n",
    "As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,\n",
    "Never so much as in a thought unborn\n",
    "Did I offend your Highness.\n",
    "FREDERICK. Thus do all traitors;\n",
    "If their purgation did consist in words,\n",
    "They are as innocent as grace itself.\n",
    "Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.\n",
    "Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.\n",
    "FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.\n",
    "ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;\n",
    "So was I when your Highness banish'd him.\n",
    "Treason is not inherited, my lord;\n",
    "Or, if we did derive it from our friends,\n",
    "What's that to me? My father was no traitor.\n",
    "Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much\n",
    "To think my poverty is treacherous.\n",
    "CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.\n",
    "FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,\n",
    "Else had she with her father rang'd along.\n",
    "CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;\n",
    "It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;\n",
    "I was too young that time to value her,\n",
    "But now I know her. If she be a traitor,\n",
    "Why so am I: we still have slept together,\n",
    "Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;\n",
    "And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,\n",
    "Still we went coupled and inseparable.\n",
    "FREDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,\n",
    "Her very silence and her patience,\n",
    "Speak to the people, and they pity her.\n",
    "Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;\n",
    "And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous\n",
    "When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.\n",
    "Firm and irrevocable is my doom\n",
    "Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.\n",
    "CELIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;\n",
    "I cannot live out of her company.\n",
    "FREDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.\n",
    "If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,\n",
    "And in the greatness of my word, you die.\n",
    "Exeunt DUKE and LORDS\n",
    "CELIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?\n",
    "Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.\n",
    "I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I have more cause.\n",
    "CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin.\n",
    "Prithee be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke\n",
    "Hath banish'd me, his daughter?\n",
    "ROSALIND. That he hath not.\n",
    "CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love\n",
    "Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.\n",
    "Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?\n",
    "No; let my father seek another heir.\n",
    "Therefore devise with me how we may fly,\n",
    "Whither to go, and what to bear with us;\n",
    "And do not seek to take your charge upon you,\n",
    "To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;\n",
    "For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,\n",
    "Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go?\n",
    "CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,\n",
    "Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!\n",
    "Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\n",
    "CELIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,\n",
    "And with a kind of umber smirch my face;\n",
    "The like do you; so shall we pass along,\n",
    "And never stir assailants.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Were it not better,\n",
    "Because that I am more than common tall,\n",
    "That I did suit me all points like a man?\n",
    "A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,\n",
    "A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart\n",
    "Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-\n",
    "We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,\n",
    "As many other mannish cowards have\n",
    "That do outface it with their semblances.\n",
    "CELIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?\n",
    "ROSALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,\n",
    "And therefore look you call me Ganymede.\n",
    "But what will you be call'd?\n",
    "CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:\n",
    "No longer Celia, but Aliena.\n",
    "ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal\n",
    "The clownish fool out of your father's court?\n",
    "Would he not be a comfort to our travel?\n",
    "CELIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;\n",
    "Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,\n",
    "And get our jewels and our wealth together;\n",
    "Devise the fittest time and safest way\n",

    "Which when it bites and blows upon my body,\n",
    "Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say\n",
    "'This is no flattery; these are counsellors\n",
    "That feelingly persuade me what I am.'\n",
    "Sweet are the uses of adversity,\n",
    "Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,\n",
    "Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;\n",
    "And this our life, exempt from public haunt,\n",
    "Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,\n",
    "Sermons in stones, and good in everything.\n",
    "I would not change it.\n",
    "AMIENS. Happy is your Grace,\n",
    "That can translate the stubbornness of fortune\n",

    "And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,\n",
    "Being native burghers of this desert city,\n",
    "Should, in their own confines, with forked heads\n",
    "Have their round haunches gor'd.\n",
    "FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord,\n",
    "The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;\n",
    "And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp\n",
    "Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.\n",
    "To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself\n",
    "Did steal behind him as he lay along\n",
    "Under an oak whose antique root peeps out\n",
    "Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!\n",
    "To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,\n",
    "That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,\n",
    "Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,\n",
    "The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans\n",
    "That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat\n",
    "Almost to bursting; and the big round tears\n",
    "Cours'd one another down his innocent nose\n",
    "In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,\n",
    "Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,\n",
    "Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,\n",
    "Augmenting it with tears.\n",
    "DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?\n",
    "Did he not moralize this spectacle?\n",
    "FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.\n",
    "First, for his weeping into the needless stream:\n",
    "'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament\n",
    "As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more\n",
    "To that which had too much.' Then, being there alone,\n",
    "Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:\n",
    "''Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part\n",
    "The flux of company.' Anon, a careless herd,\n",
    "Full of the pasture, jumps along by him\n",
    "And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques\n",
    "'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;\n",
    "'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look\n",
    "Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'\n",
    "Thus most invectively he pierceth through\n",
    "The body of the country, city, court,\n",
    "Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we\n",
    "Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,\n",
    "To fright the animals, and to kill them up\n",
    "In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.\n",
    "DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?\n",
    "SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting\n",
    "Upon the sobbing deer.\n",
    "DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place;\n",
    "I love to cope him in these sullen fits,\n",

    "The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,\n",
    "Saw her abed, and in the morning early\n",
    "They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.\n",

    "Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.\n",
    "Know you not, master, to some kind of men\n",

    "Hath heard your praises; and this night he means\n",

    "Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce\n",
    "A thievish living on the common road?\n",
    "This I must do, or know not what to do;\n",
    "Yet this I will not do, do how I can.\n",
    "I rather will subject me to the malice\n",

    "The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,\n",

    "Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,\n",
    "Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\n",
    "Seeking the bubble reputation\n",

    "it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life,\n",

    "thee, shepherd?\n",
    "CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at\n",
    "ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is\n",
    "without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,\n",
    "and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a\n",
    "great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath\n",

    "CORIN. Nay, I hope.\n",

    "one side.\n",
    "CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good\n",
    "manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must\n",
    "be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art\n",
    "in a parlous state, shepherd.\n",
    "CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the\n",
    "court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the\n",
    "country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not\n",
    "at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be\n",
    "uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.\n",

    "CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you\n",
    "know, are greasy.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the\n",
    "grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow,\n",
    "shallow. A better instance, I say; come.\n",
    "CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A\n",
    "more sounder instance; come.\n",
    "CORIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our\n",
    "sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are\n",
    "perfum'd with civet.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good\n",
    "piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is\n",
    "of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend\n",
    "the instance, shepherd.\n",
    "CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God\n",
    "make incision in thee! thou art raw.\n",
    "CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I\n",
    "wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other\n",
    "men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is\n",
    "to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes\n",
    "and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the\n",

    "a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,\n",

    "remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him\n",
    "again? Answer me in one word.\n",
    "CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too\n",
    "great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these\n",

    "CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the\n",
    "propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and\n",
    "relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a\n",

    "such fruit.\n",

    "the ground.\n",
    "CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets\n",

    "CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out\n",
    "of tune.\n",

    "JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name? ORLANDO. Yes, just. JAQUES. I\n",
    "do not like her name. ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you\n",
    "when she was christen'd. JAQUES. What stature is she of? ORLANDO.\n",
    "Just as high as my heart. JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers.\n",
    "Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them\n",
    "out of rings? ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth,\n",
    "from whence you have studied your questions. JAQUES. You have a\n",
    "nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down\n",
    "with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all\n",
    "our misery. ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but\n",
    "myself, against whom I know most faults. JAQUES. The worst fault you\n",
    "have is to be in love. ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for\n",
    "your best virtue. I am weary of you. JAQUES. By my troth, I was\n",
    "seeking for a fool when I found you. ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the\n",
    "brook; look but in, and you shall see him. JAQUES. There I shall see\n",
    "mine own figure. ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a\n",
    "cipher. JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior\n",
    "Love. ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur\n",
    "Melancholy. Exit JAQUES ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to\n",
    "him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with\n",
    "him.- Do you hear, forester? ORLANDO. Very well; what would you?\n",
    "ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock? ORLANDO. You should ask me\n",
    "what time o' day; there's no clock in the forest. ROSALIND. Then\n",
    "there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and\n",
    "groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a\n",
    "clock. ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been\n",
    "as proper? ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces\n",
    "with divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time\n",
    "trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still\n",
    "withal. ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal? ROSALIND. Marry,\n",
    "he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage\n",
    "and the day it is solemniz'd; if the interim be but a se'nnight,\n",
    "Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal? ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks\n",
    "Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps\n",
    "easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because\n",
    "he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful\n",
    "learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These\n",
    "Time ambles withal. ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal? ROSALIND.\n",
    "With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can\n",
    "fall, he thinks himself too soon there. ORLANDO. Who stays it still\n",
    "withal? ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep\n",
    "between term and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth? ROSALIND. With this\n",
    "shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe\n",
    "upon a petticoat. ORLANDO. Are you native of this place? ROSALIND. As\n",
    "the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled. ORLANDO. Your\n",
    "accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a\n",
    "dwelling. ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old\n",
    "religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an\n",
    "inland man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in\n",
    "love. I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God\n",
    "I am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he\n",
    "hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal. ORLANDO. Can you\n",
    "remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of\n",
    "women? ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one\n",
    "another as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his\n",
    "fellow-fault came to match it. ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of\n",
    "them. ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that\n",
    "are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young\n",
    "plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon\n",
    "hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name\n",
    "of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some\n",
    "good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.\n",
    "ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your\n",
    "remedy. ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he\n",
    "taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am\n",
    "sure you are not prisoner. ORLANDO. What were his marks? ROSALIND. A\n",
    "lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have\n",
    "not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected,\n",
    "which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for simply your having\n",
    "in beard is a younger brother's revenue. Then your hose should be\n",
    "ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe\n",
    "untied, and every thing about you demonstrating a careless\n",
    "desolation. But you are no such man; you are rather point-device in\n",
    "your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any\n",
    "other. ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love\n",
    "believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she\n",
    "does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie\n",
    "to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the\n",
    "verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired? ORLANDO. I swear\n",
    "to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that\n",
    "unfortunate he. ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes\n",
    "speak? ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as well\n",
    "a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not\n",
    "so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the\n",
    "whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so? ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this\n",
    "manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him\n",
    "every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish\n",
    "youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,\n",
    "fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of\n",
    "smiles; for every passion something and for no passion truly\n",
    "anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this\n",
    "colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then\n",
    "forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my\n",
    "suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness;\n",
    "which was, to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a\n",
    "nook merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take\n",
    "upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that\n",
    "there shall not be one spot of love in 't. ORLANDO. I would not be\n",
    "cured, youth. ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me\n",
    "Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me. ORLANDO. Now, by\n",
    "the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is. ROSALIND. Go with\n",
    "me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way, you shall tell me\n",
    "where in the forest you live. Will you go? ORLANDO. With all my\n",
    "heart, good youth. ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come,\n",
    "sister, will you go?\n",
    "Exeunt\n",

    "Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.\n",
    "AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and\n",
    "word? Is it a true thing?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,\n",
    "and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may\n",
    "be said as lovers they do feign.\n",
    "AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;\n",
    "now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst\n",
    "feign.\n",
    "AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty\n",
    "coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.\n",
    "JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!\n",
    "AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me\n",
    "honest.\n",

    "AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;\n",
    "sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will\n",
    "marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,\n",
    "the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in\n",
    "this place of the forest, and to couple us.\n",
    "JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.\n",
    "AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger\n",
    "in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no\n",
    "assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are\n",
    "odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end\n",
    "of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end\n",
    "of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his\n",
    "own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest\n",
    "deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore\n",
    "blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so\n",
    "is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare\n",
    "brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no\n",
    "skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes\n",
    "Sir Oliver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT\n",
    "\n",
    "Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here\n",
    "under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?\n",
    "MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.\n",
    "MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.\n",
    "JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?\n",
    "You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am\n",
    "very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be\n",
    "cover'd.\n",
    "JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and\n",
    "the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons\n",
    "bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.\n",
    "JAQUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married\n",
    "under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good\n",
    "priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but\n",
    "join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will\n",
    "prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be\n",
    "married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me\n",
    "well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me\n",
    "hereafter to leave my wife.\n",
    "JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;\n",
    "We must be married or we must live in bawdry.\n",
    "Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-\n",
    "O sweet Oliver,\n",
    "O brave Oliver,\n",
    "Leave me not behind thee.\n",
    "But-\n",
    "Wind away,\n",
    "Begone, I say,\n",
    "I will not to wedding with thee.\n",
    "Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY\n",
    "MARTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all\n",
    "shall flout me out of my calling.                       Exit\n",

    "\n",
    "Enter ROSALIND and CELIA\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.\n",
    "CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears\n",
    "do not become a man.\n",
    "ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?\n",
    "CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.\n",
    "ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.\n",
    "CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.\n",
    "Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.\n",
    "CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.\n",
    "ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of\n",
    "holy bread.\n",
    "CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of\n",
    "winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of\n",
    "chastity is in them.\n",
    "ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and\n",
    "comes not?\n",
    "CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Do you think so?\n",
    "CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but\n",
    "for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered\n",
    "goblet or a worm-eaten nut.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Not true in love?\n",
    "CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.\n",
    "ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.\n",
    "CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no\n",
    "stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer\n",
    "of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke,\n",
    "your father.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.\n",
    "He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as\n",
    "he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when\n",
    "there is such a man as Orlando?\n",
    "CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave\n",
    "words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite\n",
    "traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that\n",
    "spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble\n",
    "goose. But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who\n",
    "comes here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter CORIN\n",
    "\n",
    "CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired\n",
    "After the shepherd that complain'd of love,\n",
    "Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,\n",
    "Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess\n",
    "That was his mistress.\n",
    "CELIA. Well, and what of him?\n",
    "CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd\n",
    "Between the pale complexion of true love\n",
    "And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,\n",
    "Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,\n",
    "If you will mark it.\n",
    "ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!\n",
    "The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.\n",
    "Bring us to this sight, and you shall say\n",

    "\n",
    "SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.\n",

    "\n",
    "PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner;\n",
    "I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.\n",
    "Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.\n",
    "'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,\n",
    "That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,\n",
    "Who shut their coward gates on atomies,\n",
    "Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!\n",
    "Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;\n",
    "And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.\n",
    "Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;\n",
    "Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,\n",
    "Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.\n",
    "Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.\n",
    "Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains\n",
    "Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,\n",
    "The cicatrice and capable impressure\n",
    "Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,\n",
    "Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;\n",
    "Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes\n",
    "That can do hurt.\n",
    "SILVIUS. O dear Phebe,\n",
    "If ever- as that ever may be near-\n",
    "You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,\n",
    "Then shall you know the wounds invisible\n",
    "That love's keen arrows make.\n",
    "PHEBE. But till that time\n",
    "Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,\n",
    "Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;\n",
    "As till that time I shall not pity thee.\n",
    "ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your\n",
    "mother,\n",
    "That you insult, exult, and all at once,\n",
    "Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-\n",
    "As, by my faith, I see no more in you\n",
    "Than without candle may go dark to bed-\n",
    "Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?\n",
    "Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?\n",
    "I see no more in you than in the ordinary\n",
    "Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,\n",
    "I think she means to tangle my eyes too!\n",
    "No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;\n",
    "'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\n",
    "Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\n",
    "That can entame my spirits to your worship.\n",
    "You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\n",
    "Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?\n",
    "You are a thousand times a properer man\n",
    "Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you\n",
    "That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.\n",
    "'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;\n",
    "And out of you she sees herself more proper\n",
    "Than any of her lineaments can show her.\n",
    "But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,\n",
    "And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;\n",
    "For I must tell you friendly in your ear:\n",
    "Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.\n",
    "Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;\n",
    "Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.\n",
    "So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.\n",
    "PHEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;\n",
    "I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.\n",
    "ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall\n",
    "in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee\n",
    "with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look\n",
    "you so upon me?\n",
    "PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,\n",
    "For I am falser than vows made in wine;\n",
    "Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,\n",
    "'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.\n",
    "Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.\n",
    "Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,\n",
    "And be not proud; though all the world could see,\n",
    "None could be so abus'd in sight as he.\n",
    "Come, to our flock.        Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN\n",
    "PHEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:\n",
    "'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'\n",
    "SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe.\n",
    "PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?\n",
    "SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.\n",
    "PHEBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.\n",
    "SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.\n",
    "If you do sorrow at my grief in love,\n",
    "By giving love, your sorrow and my grief\n",
    "Were both extermin'd.\n",
    "PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?\n",
    "SILVIUS. I would have you.\n",
    "PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.\n",
    "Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;\n",
    "And yet it is not that I bear thee love;\n",
    "But since that thou canst talk of love so well,\n",
    "Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,\n",
    "I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.\n",
    "But do not look for further recompense\n",
    "Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.\n",
    "SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,\n",
    "And I in such a poverty of grace,\n",
    "That I shall think it a most plenteous crop\n",
    "To glean the broken ears after the man\n",
    "That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then\n",
    "A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.\n",
    "PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?\n",
    "SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;\n",
    "And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds\n",
    "That the old carlot once was master of.\n",
    "PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;\n",
    "'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.\n",
    "But what care I for words? Yet words do well\n",
    "When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.\n",
    "It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;\n",
    "But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.\n",
    "He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him\n",
    "Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue\n",
    "Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.\n",
    "He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;\n",
    "His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.\n",
    "There was a pretty redness in his lip,\n",
    "A little riper and more lusty red\n",
    "Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference\n",
    "Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.\n",
    "There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him\n",
    "In parcels as I did, would have gone near\n",
    "To fall in love with him; but, for my part,\n",
    "I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet\n",
    "I have more cause to hate him than to love him;\n",
    "For what had he to do to chide at me?\n",
    "He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,\n",
    "And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.\n",
    "I marvel why I answer'd not again;\n",
    "But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.\n",
    "I'll write to him a very taunting letter,\n",
    "And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?\n",
    "SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.\n",
    "PHEBE. I'll write it straight;\n",
    "The matter's in my head and in my heart;\n",
    "I will be bitter with him and passing short.\n",

    "\n",
    "Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES\n",
    "\n",
    "JAQUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with\n",
    "thee.\n",
    "ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.\n",
    "JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable\n",
    "fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than\n",
    "drunkards.\n",
    "JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.\n",
    "JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is\n",
    "emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the\n",
    "courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is\n",
    "ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,\n",
    "which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a\n",
    "melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted\n",
    "from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my\n",
    "travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous\n",
    "sadness.\n",
    "ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be\n",
    "sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then\n",
    "to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and\n",
    "poor hands.\n",
    "JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter ORLANDO\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a\n",
    "fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to\n",
    "travel for it too.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!\n",
    "JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear\n",
    "strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be\n",
    "out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making\n",
    "you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have\n",
    "swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where\n",
    "have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such\n",
    "another trick, never come in my sight more.\n",
    "ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a\n",
    "minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the\n",
    "thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said\n",
    "of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll\n",
    "warrant him heart-whole.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had\n",
    "as lief be woo'd of a snail.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Of a snail!\n",
    "ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries\n",
    "his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make\n",
    "a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.\n",
    "ORLANDO. What's that?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to\n",
    "your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents\n",
    "the slander of his wife.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.\n",
    "ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.\n",
    "CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a\n",
    "better leer than you.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,\n",
    "and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I\n",
    "were your very very Rosalind?\n",
    "ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were\n",
    "gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.\n",
    "Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for\n",
    "lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to\n",
    "kiss.\n",
    "ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new\n",
    "matter.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I\n",
    "should think my honesty ranker than my wit.\n",
    "ORLANDO. What, of my suit?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.\n",
    "Am not I your Rosalind?\n",
    "ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking\n",
    "of her.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.\n",
    "ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six\n",
    "thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man\n",
    "died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had\n",
    "his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he\n",
    "could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.\n",
    "Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had\n",
    "turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,\n",
    "good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,\n",
    "being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish\n",
    "chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these\n",
    "are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have\n",
    "eaten them, but not for love.\n",
    "ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I\n",
    "protest, her frown might kill me.\n",
    "ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I\n",
    "will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me\n",
    "what you will, I will grant it.\n",
    "ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.\n",
    "ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.\n",
    "ORLANDO. What sayest thou?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Are you not good?\n",
    "ORLANDO. I hope so.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,\n",
    "sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,\n",
    "Orlando. What do you say, sister?\n",
    "ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.\n",
    "CELIA. I cannot say the words.\n",
    "ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-\n",
    "CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?\n",
    "ORLANDO. I will.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Ay, but when?\n",
    "ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'\n",
    "ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.\n",
    "ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,\n",
    "Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;\n",
    "and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.\n",
    "ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have\n",
    "possess'd her.\n",
    "ORLANDO. For ever and a day.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are\n",
    "April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when\n",
    "they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will\n",
    "be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,\n",
    "more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than\n",
    "an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for\n",
    "nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you\n",
    "are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when\n",
    "thou are inclin'd to sleep.\n",
    "ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?\n",
    "ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.\n",
    "ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,\n",
    "the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out\n",
    "at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop\n",
    "that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.\n",
    "ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,\n",
    "whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it,\n",
    "till you met your\n",
    "wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.\n",
    "ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never\n",
    "take her without her answer, unless you take her without her\n",
    "tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's\n",
    "occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will\n",
    "breed it like a fool!\n",
    "ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!\n",
    "ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be\n",
    "with thee again.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would\n",
    "prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That\n",
    "flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and\n",
    "so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?\n",
    "ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.\n",
    "ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and\n",
    "by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot\n",
    "of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will\n",
    "think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow\n",
    "lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may\n",
    "be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore\n",
    "beware my censure, and keep your promise.\n",
    "ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my\n",
    "Rosalind; so, adieu.\n",
    "ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such\n",
    "offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO\n",
    "CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must\n",

    "ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst\n",
    "know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;\n",
    "my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.\n",
    "CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection\n",
    "in, it runs out.\n",
    "ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of\n",

    "out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,\n",
    "Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a\n",

    "It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,\n",
    "I am but as a guiltless messenger.\n",

    "She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;\n",

    "She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.\n",
    "I say she never did invent this letter:\n",

    "ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;\n",
    "A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,\n",
    "Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain\n",
    "Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,\n",

    "Left on your right hand brings you to the place.\n",
    "But at this hour the house doth keep itself;\n",
    "There's none within.\n",

    "Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,\n",
    "Of female favour, and bestows himself\n",
    "Like a ripe sister; the woman low,\n",
    "And browner than her brother.' Are not you\n",
    "The owner of the house I did inquire for?\n",
    "CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.\n",

    "What man I am, and how, and why, and where,\n",
    "This handkercher was stain'd.\n",
    "CELIA. I pray you, tell it.\n",

    "He left a promise to return again\n",
    "Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,\n",
    "Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,\n",
    "Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,\n",
    "And mark what object did present itself.\n",
    "Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,\n",
    "And high top bald with dry antiquity,\n",
    "A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,\n",
    "Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck\n",
    "A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,\n",
    "Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd\n",
    "The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,\n",
    "Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,\n",
    "And with indented glides did slip away\n",
    "Into a bush; under which bush's shade\n",
    "A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,\n",

    "The royal disposition of that beast\n",
    "To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.\n",
    "This seen, Orlando did approach the man,\n",
    "And found it was his brother, his elder brother.\n",
    "CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;\n",
    "And he did render him the most unnatural\n",
    "That liv'd amongst men.\n",

    "ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,\n",
    "Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?\n",
    "OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;\n",
    "But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,\n",
    "And nature, stronger than his just occasion,\n",
    "Made him give battle to the lioness,\n",
    "Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling\n",
    "From miserable slumber I awak'd.\n",
    "CELIA. Are you his brother?\n",
    "ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?\n",

    "So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.\n",
    "ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?\n",
    "OLIVER. By and by.\n",
    "When from the first to last, betwixt us two,\n",
    "Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,\n",
    "As how I came into that desert place-\n",
    "In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,\n",
    "Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,\n",
    "Committing me unto my brother's love;\n",
    "Who led me instantly unto his cave,\n",
    "There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm\n",
    "The lioness had torn some flesh away,\n",
    "Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,\n",
    "And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.\n",
    "Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,\n",
    "And, after some small space, being strong at heart,\n",
    "He sent me hither, stranger as I am,\n",
    "To tell this story, that you might excuse\n",
    "His broken promise, and to give this napkin,\n",
    "Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth\n",

    "this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how\n",
    "well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!\n",

    "not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do\n",
    "strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd\n",
    "with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.\n",
    "If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries\n",

    "SONG.\n",
    "It was a lover and his lass,\n",

    "DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.\n",
    "ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?\n",
    "ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.\n",
    "ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?\n",
    "PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.\n",
    "ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,\n",
    "You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?\n",
    "PHEBE. So is the bargain.\n",
    "ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?\n",

    "Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA\n",
    "DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy\n",
    "Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.\n",
    "ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him\n",
    "Methought he was a brother to your daughter.\n",
    "But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,\n",
    "And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments\n",
    "Of many desperate studies by his uncle,\n",
    "Whom he reports to be a great magician,\n",
    "Obscured in the circle of this forest.\n",

    "\n",
    "JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are\n",
    "coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which\n",
    "in all tongues are call'd fools.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!\n",
    "JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded\n",
    "gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a\n",
    "courtier, he swears.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.\n",
    "I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been\n",
    "politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone\n",
    "three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought\n",
    "one.\n",
    "JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the\n",
    "seventh cause.\n",
    "JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.\n",
    "DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in\n",
    "here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear\n",
    "and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A\n",
    "poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a\n",
    "poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich\n",
    "honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl\n",
    "in your foul oyster.\n",
    "DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet\n",
    "diseases.\n",
    "JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on\n",
    "the seventh cause?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more\n",
    "seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain\n",
    "courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not\n",
    "cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort\n",
    "Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would\n",
    "send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip\n",
    "Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.\n",
    "This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,\n",
    "he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof\n",
    "Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This\n",
    "is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie\n",
    "Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.\n",
    "JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor\n",
    "he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords\n",
    "and parted.\n",
    "JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have\n",
    "books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,\n",
    "the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the\n",
    "Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the\n",
    "Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;\n",
    "the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie\n",
    "Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven\n",
    "justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were\n",
    "met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you\n",
    "said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore\n",
    "brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.\n",
    "JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?\n",
    "He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.\n",
    "DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the\n",
    "presentation of that he shoots his wit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC\n",

    "After some question with him, was converted\n",
    "Both from his enterprise and from the world;\n",
    "His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,\n",
    "And all their lands restor'd to them again\n",

    "insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not\n",

    "way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge\n",

    "If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that\n",
